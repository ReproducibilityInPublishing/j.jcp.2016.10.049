00:33:00: I seem to be getting correct values for the upper left plot of Figure 3. I now need to automate this procedure a little bit and produce the plots as well.

01:00:00: Started process of adding arguments to programs
01:56:00: Poiseuille nonconvex program now has arguments, need to script it. I also adjusted the output so it could be run several times in succession and create a .csv file.
02:33:00: Building a script to use gnu parallel to execute all the experiments in a parallelized fashion
03:39:00: Finished building script, it takes quite a while. maybe 12 hours with 4 threads? I'll need to time it. I've now finished the nonconvex plots in Figure 3. They all seem to match exactly.

06:13:00: Trying to fix the taylor vortex problem, but I've run into a nan issue. I'm assuming for now that there is a change I made somewhere which resulted in this nan, but I need to study and fix the issue.
07:14:00: I've found that the solution is becoming singular... I'll have to think about how to solve this.
08:01:00: The jobs for Figure3 convex equation finished. They took nearly 2 days to finish running. I've now perfectly replicated Figure 3.

08:06:00: The Couette flow example is also plagued by nan and inf issues. Its possible that this is related to the stability of the problem. I'm double checking the set parameters to make sure everything is set properly.
08:10:00: I've started reading the article in depth to understand how to properly debug the inf/nan issues I'm seeing with the second two examples.
08:48:00: I may have discovered an error in the Couette example. s_q seems to be defined incorrectly, however the correct definition is just commented out above. Maybe some experimentation by the author?
08:54:00: This isn't the only problem because I'm still getting nan problems. Also when I reduce the lattice size to 11, the program segfaults.
09:31:00: The mysterious variable 'ell' is likely ellipticity of the domain.
09:34:00: It seems while the taylor green vortex appears to only concern the circular region dicussed in the paper, wikipedia says it's solved in a square domain. It's possible the error summation is only over the circular region.
10:45:00: In order to gain insight into the program I've embarked on an effort to translate some mojibaked comments in the source code. Working with my officemate we discovered that the encoding was probably 'utf-16-be'. Using the bvi hex editor I managed to extract the bytes for the mojibaked text. Then using python, I was able to load those bytes from a file, and decode them with the correct encoding. The function definition is this essentially:

def fix_mojibake(filepath, encoding='utf-16-be'):
	with open(filepath, "rb") as thefile:
		data = thefile.read()
	print(data.decode(encoding))

The correctly encoded text is a mixture of korean and chinese characters, mostly korean. I put the text into google translate which correctly identified the language, but didn't give me any translation. I've sent this text to a family friend of mine who knows korean and has phd training in physics. She will be able to tell if 1) It's gibberish indicating the encoding is still incorrect, or 2) It's technical language which google isn't able to understand. in which case she'll be able to provide a translation of these comments.
10:57:00: It's been suggested that we send code snippets to the original authors and request translations. I'm compiling a document with the comments.
11:52:00: Email sent
11:52:00: The authors replied rapidly and didn't ask any questions at all. Perhaps they would be interested in releasing their code publicly?
12:12:00: I've integrated changes and some translated comments from what they sent. The code no longer produces the nan values and I think I've figured out where the issue originated from. The s_q had the wrong sign it seems. This is the case for the taylor vortex
13:16:00: I've now done some work transforming the Vortex non convex code.
13:21:00: The Vortex non convex code still has nan problems.
